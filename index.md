# Welcome

This website provides an open-source gas-chromatography (GC)-high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectral database of archeologically relevant compounds focusing on lipids. Spectra were collected from standards and selected archaeological samples. More information on the database and an analytical workflow where it can be included can be found in the publication: (bibliographic data to be added).

## Download

Simply click on the "tar.gz" or ".zip" icons to download the database. The archive contains the database in 3 different  formats, ".msp", ".json", and ".jdx".

## How to use

The database is free to download and use for everyone, but we request that the publication (bibliographic data to be added) is acknowledged. We aim to expand the database in the future. If you have any suggestions for compounds to be included for future versions, please get in touch with us.

All provided database formats work with the open-source mass spectrometry data mining software MZmine 2.
